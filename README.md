##Technology##

RoR (Ruby on Rails)
...and a ton of GOOGLE (if that counts as a tech resource)

##My approach##

Approach this project with one goal and one goal alone! To take on a language I wasn't too familiar with and try my best to create a CRUD app. Needless to say this has been the biggest challenge for me thus far!
I thought about a topic that is very controversial to a lot of people because of the 'bad' reputation it has gotten over the past decades. I chose to build a CRUD app about marijuana. Medical studies have shown the power of this plant and how it helps maintain or even in some cases cure health issues. 
I honestly don't know how it got it's 'bad' reputation but any ALL NATURAL remedy that can help fix any health issue should be glorified not damned! 
    'But there's no business in healthy people'
--I suppose.
The app gives users a brief history of where they're favorite strain might come from with a little description.

##Installation

All the dependencies came standard with the normal installation of RoR
-Added a gemfile for the maps
