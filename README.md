##Technology##

<p>RoR (Ruby on Rails)</p>
<p>...and a ton of GOOGLE (if that counts as a tech resource)</p>

##My approach##

<p>Approach this project with one goal and one goal alone! To take on a language I wasn't too familiar with and try my best to create a CRUD app. Needless to say this has been the biggest challenge for me thus far!</p>
<p>I thought about a topic that is very controversial to a lot of people because of the 'bad' reputation it has gotten over the past decades. I chose to build a CRUD app about marijuana. Medical studies have shown the power of this plant and how it helps maintain or even in some cases cure health issues. </p>
<p>I honestly don't know how it got it's 'bad' reputation but any ALL NATURAL remedy that can help fix any health issue should be glorified not damned! </p>
    <article>'But there's no business in healthy people'</article>
<p>--I suppose.</p>
<p>The app gives users a brief history of where they're favorite strain might come from with a little description.</p>

##Installation

<p>All the dependencies came standard with the normal installation of RoR</p>
<ul>
    Added a gemfile for the maps
</ul>
##Challenges

<p>Where do I begin!! I found it difficult to make my routes workout the way I wanted to. </p>
<p>Overall I enjoyed making this app because it challenged me immensely.<p>

##Future Plans

<p>I would like to continue to work on this project. Get my routes down. Make it mobile and easier to use.</p>
